# QGIS_pluign-Network-Analysis-Tool
This is plugin used to perform Network allocation and closest facility analysis on vector a layer(a line and a point vetor layer).

1. Network Allocation: To locate the facilities in a way that supplies the demand points most efficiently. It takes two layers as input, the threshold distance and the ID of underlying points to be used. Output is a network with each point being allocated a the part of network closest to it. Also convex hulls are plotted to divide the area into regions.

2. Closest Facility: Given a road network and a point vector layer representing facilities, we can find the nearest facility from any user specified point in the map. We can also enlist the facilities within a given threshold distance from a given point in the network.
